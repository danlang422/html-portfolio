     <p>(In no particular order.)</p>

    <h3>Moulin Rouge</h3>
    <p>The first movie I ever watched multiple times in the theater. This Baz Luhrmann musical tells the story of a young poet who falls in love with a courtesan and cabaret actress at the Moulin Rouge night club. The film is visually stunning and features incredible performances by Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor.</p>
    <h3>Aladdin</h3>
    <p>I had this animated Disney classic on VHS as a kid, and had it memorized after watching it so many times. The story of Aladdin, a "street-rat" who discovers a magical lamp and a genie who grants him three wishes, is a timeless tale of adventure, romance, and self-discovery. The film features memorable songs and a standout performance by Robin Williams as the Genie.</p>
    <h3>The Nines</h3>
    <p>The Nines always sticks in my mind as a favorite, although I'd be hard pressed to give you the details. This psychological thriller stars Ryan Reynolds in multiple roles, exploring themes of reality and identity. The film is thought-provoking and keeps you guessing until the very end.</p>
    <h3>Moana</h3>
    <p>I think Moana, perhaps weirdly, represents the best of what I think of as "American values." This animated Disney film tells the story of a young Polynesian girl who sets out on a daring journey to save her people. The movie features stunning animation, memorable songs, and is one of the few Disney films where there isn't really a villain. I think Moana's entire story presents themes of immigration, emigration, cooperation, communication, empathy, and community. All of which are foundational elements of America's founding, and are what I hope Americans aspire to, today.</p>
    <h3>Amelie</h3>
    <p>I don't think I'd ever seen anything quite like Amelie when I first watched it. This whimsical French film tells the story of a shy waitress who decides to change the lives of those around her for the better, while grappling with her own isolation. The film is visually stunning and features a standout performance by Audrey Tautou in the lead role. Amelie is a heartwarming and uplifting film that celebrates the power of kindness and human connection.</p>
