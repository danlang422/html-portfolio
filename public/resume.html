    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm just starting my journey in learning web development, so please excuse the simplicity of this site (my Canva and Docs resumes look better, I promise!). I'm an educator with a passion for turning chaos into clarity. I have a knack for designing systems that help people understand complex ideas, whether that's through intuitive documentation, user-friendly tech solutions, or creative learning experiences. I try to eliminate friction in systems—usually by reimagining how information flows and creating resources that actually make sense to the people using them. I'm passionate about making knowledge accessible to everyone and building bridges between technical content and human understanding.</p>
